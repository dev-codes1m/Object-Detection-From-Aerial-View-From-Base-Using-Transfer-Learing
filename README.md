# Object-Detection-From-Aerial-View-From-Base-Using-Transfer-Learning

## This Model Detect Only 3 Categories of Object (People, car, trash) although the model is not trained on large dataset but if it will be trained it will work fine
### The Most Valuable Thing of this Model is that it is made from scratch using transfer learning and hence it is best for beginner who wants to learn object Detection using opencv
